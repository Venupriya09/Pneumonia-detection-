# Pneumonia Detection using Chest X-ray Images

## Overview
This project aims to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques. It includes data loading, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation steps.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset available on Kaggle. It consists of X-ray images categorized into 'NORMAL' and 'PNEUMONIA' classes.

## Approach
1. Data Loading: The dataset is loaded and split into training, validation, and test sets.
2. Preprocessing: Images are resized, converted to grayscale, and normalized before feeding into the model.
3. Model Architecture: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is built with multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers.
4. Model Training: The model is trained on the training set with data augmentation and oversampling techniques applied to handle class imbalance.
5. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on the test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Results: Confusion matrix and classification report provide insights into the model's performance.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script to train and evaluate the model: `python pneumonia_detection.py`
